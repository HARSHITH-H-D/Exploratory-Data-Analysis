# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìÑ Description
This repository contains the code, data, and results for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis and data science workflow, where we uncover insights, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize the main characteristics of the data using both visual and quantitative methods.
